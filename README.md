DanielsGameOfLifeV2 current version : v1.2 (in-development)

This program from the off is designed for multiple purposes.
For instance it can be used as an amusing screen saver simulation which it sure is very good at being amusing but it was more so designed to be able to model real-world complex events. That is of course the end goal
and by no means is it close to that. 
Currently I am creating the infrastructure to which I can build ontop a hopefully useful and rather diverse piece of software for modelling an event of your choice.

It does this using cellular automata. Cellular automata are, from my point of view, an underrated segment of computer science which is yet to be fully explored. In the past they have proven to be a reliable way of
modelling data consistently. I am effectively personally researching the modelling of data to see what cellular automata are really capable of.
